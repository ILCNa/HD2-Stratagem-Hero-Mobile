## 🧠 Developer’s Notes  
Recently I got hooked on a game called “Super Earth Defense,” and coincidentally, I was learning Android development at school.  
It suddenly occurred to me: why not make this mini-game into an Android app?  
Imagine giving tactical commands just like in *Helldivers*, but on a touchscreen.  
It seemed like a fun idea.  
Honestly, this project is rough around the edges — the code is messy and far from perfect, so I won’t open source it.  
In the end, it’s just a little hobby project to casually enjoy, with no grand expectations.
