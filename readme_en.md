# Stratagem Hero Mobile  
###### A Silly Tactical Ball-Tapping Game for Android 7.0+

- A fan-made mini game whipped up by a grad school exam candidate during study breaks. (Truly off the rails.)
- Back by popular demand: added a tiny virtual keyboard! Now supports both on-screen and external input. (Hope you enjoy it.)
- **If you like it, please consider giving it a star ⭐—thanks!**
- **If you or a friend need art assets, feel free to grab them from the `resources` folder.**
- A non-official tactical mini-game inspired by *Helldivers II*, now on Android.
- Fully offline, ad-free, pure single-player fun—tactical decisions anytime, anywhere.

## 🧠 From the Developer

So... I got a little obsessed with *Super Earth Defense War*,  
and around the same time, my school was teaching Android development.  
Then this random idea struck me:  
> “Why not turn this mini-game into an actual Android app?”

Just imagine—like a real Helldiver, inputting tactical commands via touchscreen.  
Honestly, the idea sounded kinda cool.

Truth is, this little project is messy.  
The code? A steaming pile of spaghetti.  
So yeah, I’m **not** open-sourcing it. 🙈  
At the end of the day, it’s just a tiny toy to pass the time. Don’t expect too much.

> If you enjoyed the game, you’re welcome to fuel my next dev session with a cup of bubble tea ☕.
