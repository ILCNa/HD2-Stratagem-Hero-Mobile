# Stratagem Hero Mobile

###### A Finger-Flicking Tactical Mini-Game for Galactic Peace

- Made by a broke college student preparing for exams. Zero budget. Blurry graphics. Tons of bugs.  
- Somehow found time between liberating the galaxy to recreate the **"Stratagem Hero"** mini-game from the Super Citizen Edition of *Helldivers II*.  
  Will anyone actually like this kind of thing? (´I`)

- **If you enjoy the project, feel free to give it a ⭐! Thanks!**

- **Need art assets? You’re welcome to take anything from the `resources/` folder.**

- A **fan-made tactical mini-game** inspired by *Helldivers II*, now on Android.  
- Completely offline, no ads, no tracking—just good old tactical fun, anytime, anywhere.

## 🧠 A Word from the Developer

As we all know, *Helldivers II* has this exclusive mini-game—  
Only accessible if you bought the **Super Citizen Edition**, played on the Super Destroyer:  
**Stratagem Hero**.

Not long ago, I got super into "Defending Super Earth,"  
and meanwhile, we were learning Android development at school.  

So I thought—why not try recreating the mini-game as a mobile app?

Just imagine: like a true Helldiver, inputting stratagems via touchscreen.  
It actually sounds... kinda fun.

To be honest, this project’s a bit of a mess.  
The code is... tragic.  
From a small mountain of spaghetti to a big one.

So hey, treat it as a small, silly toy—don’t expect too much. 😉
