> 自取吧,随便用.😋

- 音效资源来自互联网的各个角落
- 背景资源是随便PS的
- 图标资源来自项目https://github.com/nvigneux/Helldivers-2-Stratagems-icons-svg?tab=readme-ov-file
- 图标转xml实在麻烦,找了自动化工具发现不够方便,最后索性自己一点点导入,所以顺便打包分享了.

- icon_drawable:是项目利用到的所有图标资源
- images:部分图片素材
- sounds:音效音乐素材

*ps:代码写的太混乱就不放出来丢人了,一般本科生水平.*

>Feel free to use these resources 😋

- Sound effects are collected from various corners of the internet.
- Background images were casually created in Photoshop.
- Icon resources are from the open-source project:https://github.com/nvigneux/Helldivers-2-Stratagems-icons-svg?tab=readme-ov-file
- Converting the SVG icons to XML was quite a hassle. I tried some automation tools, but none were convenient enough—so I ended up importing them manually, one by one.

Resource folders:
icon_drawable: All the icon resources used in this project
images: A selection of image assets
sounds: Sound and music assets

*ps: The code is too messy to share—would be embarrassing. Just typical undergrad level.*
